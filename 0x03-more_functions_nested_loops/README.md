# 0x02. C - functions, nested loops

## Description

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

 - What are nested loops and how to use them
 - What is a function and how do you use functions
 - What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
 - What is a prototype
 - Scope of variables
 - What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra
 - What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Tasks
###0. isupper

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-main.c 0-isupper.c -o 0-isuper
$ ./0-isupper

###1. isdigit

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-isdigit.c -o 1-isdigit
$ ./1-isdigit

###2. Collaboration is multiplication

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 2-main.c 2-mul.c -o 2-mul
$ ./2-mul

###3. The numbers speak for themselves

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 3-main.c 3-print\_numbers.c -o 3-print\_numbers
$ ./3-print\_numbers

###4. I believe in numbers and signs

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 4-main.c 4-print\_most\_numbers.c -o 4-print\_most\_numbers 
$ ./4-print\_most\_numbers

###5. Numbers constitute the only universal language

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 5-main.c 5-more\_numbers.c -o 5-more\_numbers
$ ./5-more\_numbers

###6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 6-main.c 6-print\_line.c -o 6-lines
$ ./6-lines

###7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 7-main.c 7-print\_diagonal.c -o 7-diagonals
$ ./7-diagonals

###8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch

Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 8-main.c 8-print\_square.c -o 8-squares 
$ ./8-squares

###9. Fizz-Buzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 9-fizz\_buzz.c -o 9-fizz\_buzz
$ ./fizz\_buzz

###10. Triangles

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 10-main.c 10-print\_triangle.c -o 10-triangles
$ ./10-triangles

###11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

###12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

Write a function that prints an integer.
