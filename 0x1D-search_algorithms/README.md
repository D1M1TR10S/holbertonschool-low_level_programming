# 0x1D. C - Search Algorithms

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn the following concepts:

 - What is a search algorithm
 - What is a linear search
 - What is a binary search
 - What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tasks

##0. Linear search
0-linear.c

Write a function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 0-main.c 0-linear.c -o 0-linear
$ ./0-linear

##1. Binary search
1-binary.c

Write a function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 1-main.c 1-binary.c -o 1-binary
$ ./1-binary
