# 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

## Description
The purpose of this project was to gain familiarity with the building blocks of C Language, and programming in general. I gained enough understanding to explain these various concepts:
- What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them
- What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them
- What the the relational operators and how to use them
- What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C
- What are the boolean operators and how to use them
- How to use the if, if ... else statements
- How to use comments
- How to declare variables of types char, int, unsigned int
- How to affect values to variables
- How to print the values of variables of type char, int, unsigned int with printf
- How to use the while loop
- How to use variables with the while loop
- How to print variables using printf
- What is the ASCII character set
- What are the purpose of the gcc flags -m32 and -m64
 
## Tasks
###0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. 

###1. The last digit

This program assigns a random number to the variable n each time it is executed.

###2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

This program prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. Only uses the putchar function.

###3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

This program prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line. It excludes the letters q and e.

###4. alphABET

This program prints the alphabet, in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.

###5. Numbers

This program prints all numbers of base 10, starting from 0, followed by a new line.

###6. Numberz

This program prints all numbers of base 10, starting from 0, followed by a new line. Only used the putchar function.

###7. Smile in the mirror

This program prints the alphabet, in reverse order, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

###8. Hexadecimal

This program prints all the numbers of base 16, in lowercase, followed by a new line.

###9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success

This program prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.

###10. 00...99

This program prints numbers from 00 to 99.
