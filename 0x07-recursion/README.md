# Recursion

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn what recursion is and how to use it.

## Tasks

###0. She locked away a secret, deep inside herself, something she once knew to be true... but chose to forget

This function prints a string, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 0-main.c 0-puts\_recursion.c -o 0-puts\_recursion
$ ./0-puts\_recursion

###1. Why is it so important to dream? Because, in my dreams we are together

This function prints a string in reverse.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 1-main.c 1-print\_rev\_recursion.c -o 1-print\_rev\_recursion
$ ./1-print\_rev\_recursion

###2. Dreams feel real while we're in them. It's only when we wake up that we realize something was actually strange

This function returns the length of a string.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra  2-main.c 2-strlen\_recursion.c -o 2-strlen\_recursion
$ ./2-strlen\_recursion

###3. You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger, darling

This function returns the factorial of a given number.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 3-main.c 3-factorial.c -o 3-factorial
$ ./3-factorial

###4. Once an idea has taken hold of the brain it's almost impossible to eradicate

This function returns the value of x raised to the power of y.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 4-main.c 4-pow\_recursion.c -o 4-pow
$ ./4-pow

###5. Your subconscious is looking for the dreamer

This function returns the natural square root of a number.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 5-main.c 5-sqrt\_recursion.c -o 5-sqrt
$ ./5-sqrt

###6. Inception. Is it possible?

This function returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 6-main.c 6-is\_prime\_number.c -o 6-prime
$ ./6-prime

###7. They say we only use a fraction of our brain's true potential. Now that's when we're awake. When we're asleep, we can do almost anything

This function returns 1 if a string is a palindrome and 0 if not.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 7-main.c 7-is\_palindrome.c -o 7-palindrome
$ ./7-palindrome

###8. Inception. Now, before you bother telling me it's impossible...

This function compares two strings and returns 1 if the strings can be considered identical, otherwise return 0.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 100-main.c 100-wildcmp.c -o 100-wildcmp
$ ./100-wildcmp
