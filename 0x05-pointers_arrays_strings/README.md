# 0x05. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

## Description

At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

 - What are pointers and how to use them
 - What are arrays and how to use them
 - What are the differences between pointers and arrays
 - How to use strings and how to manipulate them
 - Scope of variables

## Tasks

###0. strcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-main.c 0-strcat.c -o 0-strcat
$ ./0-strcat

###1. strncat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-strncat.c -o 1-strncat
$ ./1-strncat

###2. strncpy

Write a function that copies a string.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 2-main.c 2-strncpy.c -o 2-strncpy
$ ./2-strncpy

###3. strcmp

Write a function that compares two strings.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 3-main.c 3-strcmp.c -o 3-strcmp
$ ./3-strcmp

###4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy

Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 4-main.c 4-rev\_array.c -o 4-rev\_array
$ ./4-rev\_array

###5. Always look up

Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 5-main.c 5-string\_toupper.c -o 5-string\_toupper
$ ./5-string\_toupper

###6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes

Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 6-main.c 6-cap\_string.c -o 6-cap
$ ./6-cap

###7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody

Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 7-main.c 7-leet.c -o 7-1337
$ ./7-1337

###8. rot13

Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 8-main.c 8-rot13.c -o 8-rot13
$ ./8-rot13

###9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

Write a function that prints an integer.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra \_putchar.c 100-main.c 100-print\_number.c -o 100-print\_numbers
$ ./100-print\_numbers

###10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work

Add one line to a codebase, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.
