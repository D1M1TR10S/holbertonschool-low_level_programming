# 0x0F. C - Variadic functions

## Description

The purpose of this project is to learn the following concepts:

 - What are variadic functions
 - How to use va\_start, va\_arg and va\_end macros
 - Why and how to use the const type qualifier

## Tasks

###0. Beauty is variable, ugliness is constant

Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 0-main.c 0-sum\_them\_all.c -o a
$ ./a

###1. To be is to be the value of a variable

Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 1-main.c 1-print\_numbers.c -o b
$ ./b

###2. One woman's constant is another woman's variable

Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.

$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra 2-main.c 2-print\_strings.c -o c
$ ./c

###3. To be is a to be the value of a variable
